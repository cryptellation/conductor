# Environment & GitHub CLI Rules

## .env for Tests
- Always load environment variables from `.env` (not example files) before running tests, locally or in CI.
- Use `direnv`, `dotenv`, or a shell command to source `.env`.
- Document required variables (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`) in tests or README.
- Tests must skip gracefully if required variables are missing (see `internal/adapters/github/client_test.go`).
- Example:
  ```sh
  export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs) && go test ./...
  ```

## GitHub CLI Usage
- Unset `GITHUB_TOKEN` before using `gh` CLI:
  ```sh
  unset GITHUB_TOKEN && gh <command>
  ```
- If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set, use the Go client or API directly.
- Document in scripts/README when and why `gh` is used instead of the Go client or API.

# Development Workflow Rules

## Branching & PRs
- Never push directly to `main`.
- All changes must be on a feature/fix branch (`feat-`, `fix-`, or `BREAKING-CHANGE-` prefix).
- Always create a pull request (PR) for changes. Merge only after review and all CI checks pass.

## Status Tracking
- Set the subtask status to `in progress` at the start, and to `done` right before committing (after confirming all relevant changes are staged).

## Commit & Review
- Commit all work to the feature/fix branch.
- Prompt the user for review when implementation is complete.
- Status remains `done` until user review and all tests are green.

## Automated Post-Review Steps
- After user approval, perform these steps automatically (no user intervention unless errors/input needed):
  1. Run Dagger tests (if required by `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`).
  2. Create a branch (if not already on one).
  3. Commit all changes.
  4. Push to GitHub.
  5. Create a PR.
  6. **Wait at least 10 seconds after PR creation before running PR checks** to ensure all checks have started.
  7. Wait for PR checks to pass using:
     ```sh
     gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch
     ```
  8. Merge the PR automatically when all checks are green.
  9. Switch to `main` and pull latest changes after merge.
- **If any error occurs during these steps, especially if there is an error in the tests, the process must stop immediately and not proceed further.**

## Example Statuses
- `to do`: Not started
- `in progress`: Task is being worked on
- `done`: Task is completed, reviewed, and approved by a human (set just before commit).

## Example Workflow
1. Edit code on a feature/fix branch.
2. Run `dagger develop` if Dagger module changed.
3. Open a PR to `main` and wait for review/CI.
4. Merge only after all checks are green.
5. Use the new code in `main`.
6. Cursor prompts the user for review and test confirmation
7. After user approval and confirmation that all tests pass, Cursor pushes the new branch to GitHub
8. Cursor creates a pull request, waits for all required checks to pass and merges the PR automatically, or merges immediately if there are no checks
9. Once the PR is merged, Cursor switches back to main and pulls the latest changes
