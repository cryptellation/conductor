# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
    ```
    .cursor/rules/
    ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    ├── another-rule.mdc
    └── ...
    ```

2. **Always include the header at the top of every rule file.** The header must contain at least the following fields: `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply`. The header must never be deleted or omitted from any rule file.

3. Follow the naming convention:
    - Use kebab-case for filenames
    - Always use .mdc extension
    - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

4. Directory structure:
    ```
    PROJECT_ROOT/
    ├── .cursor/
    │   └── rules/
    │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    │       └── ...
    └── ...
    ```

5. Never place rule files:
    - In the project root
    - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
    - In any other location

6. Cursor rules have the following structure:

```
---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/*
alwaysApply: false
---
# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines

Example:

```typescript
// Good example
function goodExample() {
  // Implementation following guidelines
}

// Bad example
function badExample() {
  // Implementation not following guidelines
}
```

**Be sure that the header is present and correct when you finish a new rule. Never delete or omit the header.**

## Header Enforcement

**Automated or manual header checks are required for all rule files in `.cursor/rules/`.**

- **Every rule file in `.cursor/rules/` must always start with a header** containing at least:
  - `---`
  - `description:`
  - `globs:`
  - `alwaysApply:`
- **The header must never be deleted or omitted.**
- The header must be at the very top of the file, before any other content.
- If you add or modify a rule file, you must ensure the header is present and correct.
- PRs or commits that add or modify rule files **must be blocked or flagged** if the header is missing or malformed.
- Manual and AI review is required for header correctness and completeness.

**Example header:**
```markdown
---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/*
alwaysApply: false
---
```

**Never delete or omit the header from any rule file.**
```

Be sure that the header is correct when you finish a new rule.
