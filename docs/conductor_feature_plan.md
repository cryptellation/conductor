## 1. Dependency Management

- **1.6. Version Detection**
  - 1.6.1 Implement version detection using the GitHub adapter to get tags and detect the last version of each dependency.
    - Status: done
    - Implementation clarifications (2024-06-10):
      - Only semantic versioning tags are considered (e.g., v1.2.3). Non-semver tags are ignored.
      - Pre-release tags (e.g., v1.2.3-beta) are ignored for now.
      - Only repositories/services listed in the config (roots of the dependency graph) are processed.
      - The dependency graph (from depgraph) is the source of the map to update.
      - The Service struct should be updated to include a field for the latest version tag (field name: CurrentVersion).
      - The result is only displayed using a simple print statement (no special formatting).
      - Repositories with no tags are ignored (not an error).
      - Any error fetching tags (other than no tags) should cause the process to fail immediately (fail fast).
      - Only the happy path is tested (no edge cases for now).
      - Tests use only mocks (no real GitHub calls yet) and are placed in a new test file.
      - The logic should be implemented in new files under pkg/repofetcher.
      - Not exposed via CLI or as a public API yet.

- **1.7. Inconsistency Detection**
  - 1.7.1 Detect inconsistencies between the last version of a dependency and the version used in libraries/services on all repositories, based on the dependency graph and version detection.
    - Status: done
    - Implementation clarifications (2024-06-11):
      - Only repositories/services listed in the config (roots of the dependency graph) are checked for inconsistencies.
      - Only direct dependencies are checked (not transitive dependencies).
      - An inconsistency is defined as: the latest version of a dependency (as detected) is greater than the version used by a service/library in its direct dependencies (any difference, not just major/minor).
      - Only semantic versioning tags are considered (e.g., v1.2.3). Non-semver and pre-release tags are ignored.
      - Use the most common Go semantic versioning library for version comparison.
      - The logic should be implemented in a new file under `pkg/depgraph` as a new struct with its own interface and mock, named `InconsistencyChecker`, with a function `Check`.
      - The `Check` function should take the dependency graph (`map[string]*Service`) as parameter and return a `map[string]map[string]Mismatch`, where the first string is the service Go module path, the second is its dependency Go module path, and `Mismatch` is a struct with `Actual` and `Latest` version fields (no additional fields).
      - The output should only contain mismatched dependencies (no output for up-to-date dependencies).
      - If a dependency has no detected latest version (e.g., no tags), it is skipped (not an error).
      - Any error during the process should cause a fail-fast (immediate failure) with a descriptive error message.
      - Tests should use only mocks (generated with Uber gomock) and cover the happy path (no edge cases required).
      - The logic should be internal and used by `pkg/conductor/conductor.go` to print mismatches (simple print output only).

## 2. Automated Merge Requests

- **2.1. Dagger workflow**
  - 2.1.1 Implement a way to git clone a project with Dagger
    - Status: in progress
    - Implementation clarifications (2024-06-12):
      - Implement as a Go function in `/pkg/dagger` (not as a Dagger module).
      - The function should use the Dagger Go SDK to perform a shallow git clone of a given repository URL.
      - The function signature should return a Dagger Directory (`*dagger.Directory`) for chaining with other Dagger steps.
      - The branch to clone should default to "main" but be defined as a constant in `/pkg/dagger` for easy future changes.
      - Use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided to Conductor for authentication (supporting private repos). The token should be passed explicitly to the workflow and set as a Dagger secret if possible.
      - The function should fail fast on any error.
      - The function should log progress using the same logger as the rest of Conductor (e.g., zap). Only Conductor logs should be shown; Dagger-internal logs should be suppressed or not shown to the user.
      - No submodules required for now.
      - The function should be designed for integration into the Conductor workflow, not as a standalone CLI or Dagger module.
      - The cloned directory should be accessible for subsequent Dagger steps (e.g., updating dependencies, committing, pushing).
      - No special Git version or features required.
      - No need to export the directory to the host filesystem unless required by later steps.
      - Do not modify or touch any existing Dagger modules.
      - The `CloneRepo` function should be part of an `UpdateDependencyWorkflow` function in `/pkg/dagger`, which will also include steps for 2.2 and 2.3 in the future.
      - The `UpdateDependencyWorkflow` should accept the mismatches from `conductor.go` (type: `map[string]map[string]depgraph.Mismatch`) and a context for logging, and will be called from there.
  - 2.1.2 Implement a way to update a go dependency in the cloned project using Dagger
  - 2.1.3 Implement a way to commit and push the change to a new branch using Dagger and the same image as 2.1.1

- **2.2. MR Creation Logic**
  - 2.2.1 Implement logic to create merge requests in affected repositories.
    - Status: 
  - 2.2.2 Populate MRs with relevant changes (e.g., dependency version bumps).
    - Status: 

- **2.3. MR Status Tracking**
  - 2.3.1 Track the status of created MRs (open, merged, closed, etc.).
    - Status: 
  - 2.3.2 Notify or log progress for each MR.
    - Status: 

- **2.4. Error Handling & Retries**
  - 2.4.1 Handle failed MR creations or API errors.
    - Status: 
  - 2.4.2 Implement retry and notification mechanisms.

# Development Workflow Rules

## Feature Development Phase
- **First Phase**: Develop the feature, write tests, and ensure code quality
- **Tests and linting MUST ONLY be executed through Dagger** â€“ never run `go test` or `golangci-lint` directly
- Run local tests and linting during development using Dagger commands
- Set subtask status to `in progress` when starting development
- Only proceed to shipping phase when user explicitly approves (e.g., "ship it", "ready to ship", etc.)

_Review and adjust this plan as needed to fit project requirements and priorities._

# Completed Tasks

## 1. Dependency Management

- **1.1. Define Configuration Format**
  - 1.1.1 Specify how repositories, services, and libraries are listed in a YAML configuration file.
    - Status: done

- **1.2. Configuration Loading**
  - 1.2.1 Use Viper to create a `main.go` under `cmd/conductor` that loads the YAML config.
    - Status: done

- **1.3. GitHub Client Adapter**
  - 1.3.1 Create an adapter under `internal/adapter` that proxies the GitHub Go client, allowing for interface abstraction and testing.
    - Status: done
  - 1.3.2 Add a test to ensure the adapter can retrieve a file from a repository on GitHub.
    - Status: done
  - 1.3.3 Add a test to ensure the adapter can retrieve the tags of a repository hosted on GitHub.
    - Status: done
  - 1.3.4 Add the tests to a Dagger module (under .dagger), a CI/CD framework, to execute those tests.
    - Status: done

- **1.4. Repository Discovery**
  - 1.4.1 Use the configuration and the adapter to get the content of the configured repositories (no automatic discovery). The business logic should be written in `internal/core`, should use the Github adapter (via interface with dependency injection) and be used by the command in `cmd/conductor`. Use Uber gomock to mock the Github adapter.
    - Status: done

- **1.5. Dependency Graph Construction**
  - 1.5.1 Using the repofetcher, it should pull the go.mod in the repositories listed in the configuration. This should be done in the conductor package.
    - Status: done
  - 1.5.2 Use the dependencies versioning to build a dependency graph: the dependency graph builder should be in its own package under /pkg and be used by /pkg/conductor. The builder must:
    - Receive as input a map of repository module paths to their go.mod file contents (as parsed by the repofetcher)
    - Output a map of module path to a Service struct, where Service contains at least:
      - The module path (string)
      - The repository URL (string)
      - A map of dependencies (map[module path]*Service)
    - There should never be duplicate Service structs for the same module path; all dependencies should point to the same instance
    - The builder should be in its own package under /pkg and be used by /pkg/conductor
    - Tests must be provided for the builder
    - /pkg/conductor should be updated to use the builder
    - Status: done 

- **1.6. Version Detection**
  - 1.6.1 Implement version detection using the GitHub adapter to get tags and detect the last version of each dependency.
    - Status: done
    - Implementation clarifications (2024-06-10):

      - Pre-release tags (e.g., v1.2.3-beta) are ignored for now.
      - Only repositories/services listed in the config (roots of the dependency graph) are processed.
      - The dependency graph (from depgraph) is the source of the map to update.
      - The Service struct should be updated to include a field for the latest version tag (field name: CurrentVersion).
      - The result is only displayed using a simple print statement (no special formatting).
      - Repositories with no tags are ignored (not an error).
      - Any error fetching tags (other than no tags) should cause the process to fail immediately (fail fast).
      - Only the happy path is tested (no edge cases for now).
      - Tests use only mocks (no real GitHub calls yet) and are placed in a new test file.
      - The logic should be implemented in new files under pkg/repofetcher.
      - Not exposed via CLI or as a public API yet.
