## 1. Dependency Management

- **1.6. Version Detection**
  - 1.6.1 Implement version detection using the GitHub adapter to get tags and detect the last version of each dependency.
    - Status: done
    - Implementation clarifications (2024-06-10):
      - Only semantic versioning tags are considered (e.g., v1.2.3). Non-semver tags are ignored.
      - Pre-release tags (e.g., v1.2.3-beta) are ignored for now.
      - Only repositories/services listed in the config (roots of the dependency graph) are processed.
      - The dependency graph (from depgraph) is the source of the map to update.
      - The Service struct should be updated to include a field for the latest version tag (field name: CurrentVersion).
      - The result is only displayed using a simple print statement (no special formatting).
      - Repositories with no tags are ignored (not an error).
      - Any error fetching tags (other than no tags) should cause the process to fail immediately (fail fast).
      - Only the happy path is tested (no edge cases for now).
      - Tests use only mocks (no real GitHub calls yet) and are placed in a new test file.
      - The logic should be implemented in new files under pkg/repofetcher.
      - Not exposed via CLI or as a public API yet.

- **1.7. Inconsistency Detection**
  - 1.7.1 Detect inconsistencies between the last version of a dependency and the version used in libraries/services on all repositories, based on the dependency graph and version detection.
    - Status: to do

# Development Workflow Rules

## Feature Development Phase
- **First Phase**: Develop the feature, write tests, and ensure code quality
- **Tests and linting MUST ONLY be executed through Dagger** â€“ never run `go test` or `golangci-lint` directly
- Run local tests and linting during development using Dagger commands
- Set subtask status to `in progress` when starting development
- Only proceed to shipping phase when user explicitly approves (e.g., "ship it", "ready to ship", etc.)

_Review and adjust this plan as needed to fit project requirements and priorities._

# Completed Tasks

## 1. Dependency Management

- **1.1. Define Configuration Format**
  - 1.1.1 Specify how repositories, services, and libraries are listed in a YAML configuration file.
    - Status: done

- **1.2. Configuration Loading**
  - 1.2.1 Use Viper to create a `main.go` under `cmd/conductor` that loads the YAML config.
    - Status: done

- **1.3. GitHub Client Adapter**
  - 1.3.1 Create an adapter under `internal/adapter` that proxies the GitHub Go client, allowing for interface abstraction and testing.
    - Status: done
  - 1.3.2 Add a test to ensure the adapter can retrieve a file from a repository on GitHub.
    - Status: done
  - 1.3.3 Add a test to ensure the adapter can retrieve the tags of a repository hosted on GitHub.
    - Status: done
  - 1.3.4 Add the tests to a Dagger module (under .dagger), a CI/CD framework, to execute those tests.
    - Status: done

- **1.4. Repository Discovery**
  - 1.4.1 Use the configuration and the adapter to get the content of the configured repositories (no automatic discovery). The business logic should be written in `internal/core`, should use the Github adapter (via interface with dependency injection) and be used by the command in `cmd/conductor`. Use Uber gomock to mock the Github adapter.
    - Status: done

- **1.5. Dependency Graph Construction**
  - 1.5.1 Using the repofetcher, it should pull the go.mod in the repositories listed in the configuration. This should be done in the conductor package.
    - Status: done
  - 1.5.2 Use the dependencies versioning to build a dependency graph: the dependency graph builder should be in its own package under /pkg and be used by /pkg/conductor. The builder must:
    - Receive as input a map of repository module paths to their go.mod file contents (as parsed by the repofetcher)
    - Output a map of module path to a Service struct, where Service contains at least:
      - The module path (string)
      - The repository URL (string)
      - A map of dependencies (map[module path]*Service)
    - There should never be duplicate Service structs for the same module path; all dependencies should point to the same instance
    - The builder should be in its own package under /pkg and be used by /pkg/conductor
    - Tests must be provided for the builder
    - /pkg/conductor should be updated to use the builder
    - Status: done 

- **1.6. Version Detection**
  - 1.6.1 Implement version detection using the GitHub adapter to get tags and detect the last version of each dependency.
    - Status: done
    - Implementation clarifications (2024-06-10):
      - Only semantic versioning tags are considered (e.g., v1.2.3). Non-semver tags are ignored.

      - Only repositories/services listed in the config (roots of the dependency graph) are processed.
      - The dependency graph (from depgraph) is the source of the map to update.
      - The Service struct should be updated to include a field for the latest version tag (field name: CurrentVersion).
      - The result is only displayed using a simple print statement (no special formatting).
      - Repositories with no tags are ignored (not an error).
      - Any error fetching tags (other than no tags) should cause the process to fail immediately (fail fast).
